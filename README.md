Ransomware in Python as a proof-of-concept research. Encrypts/decrypts specified files on the user's path, using a hybrid RSA asymmetric model encrypting an AES session key used to encrypt file data. 
Version 2 because of entirely re-designed encryption and key model using the PyCryptodome package.
